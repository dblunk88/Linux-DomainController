- TEST EVERY NEW IMPLEMENTATION THOROUGHLY, DO NOT GIVE ME BROKEN THINGS
- Set up a Github CI/CD to test everything, if there is a new implementation, include it into the CI/CD. Also make sure to include all packages that need to be installed
- If you need anything added to the environment, let the user know so that they can add it (keep in mind that you are working in an offline environment)
- For APT installs:
  - export DEBIAN_FRONTEND=noninteractive # Set the debconf frontend to noninteractive
  - Install the packages
  - unset DEBIAN_FRONTEND
- To test, fully run the script test every implementation thoroughly
- Also use samba-ad-dc
- I included Docker. Please set up various servers and users to fully test all functionality of the fully set-up DC
