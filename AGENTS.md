- Test every implementation thoroughly
- Set up a Github CI/CD to test everything, if there is a new implementation, include it into the CI/CD. Also make sure to include all packages that need to be installed
- If you need anything added to the environment, let the user know so that they can add it (keep in mind that you are working in an offline environment)
